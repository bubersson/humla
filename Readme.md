# Humla
Humla is an open source project of HTML5 presentation environment inspired by HTML5Rocks.

Similarly as Beamer exist for Latexers, Humla'a aim is to provide environment for creating slides for presentations in HTML while 
utilizing extensive HTML5 features. Humla is particularly 
useful for technical presentations and was originally created as a tool for the Czech Technical University courses Middleware and Web Services 
and Web 2.0.

There is currently no IDE available, slides must be edited directly in HTML.

Feel free to fork Humla, write plugins and patch it yourself!

# Features

  * Every slide has a unique URL.
  * Plugin architecture with views and extensions. 
  * A view allows to define the way how slides are presented; there is currently a browsing view 
    for convenient slides browsing, a slideshow view for presentations, a grid view for overview of slides in a presentation,
    and a print view for printing slides.
  * An extension defines processing of slides' content such as for replacment of variables, online integration with pictures from 
    Google Drawing, online integration with github to display a code, Latex formulas, etc.
