CHANGES:

0.2.1
- new extension: github - a code can be linked with the code at github;
  also stores the code in localstorage for fast loading
- events changed to interfaces: views and extensions, events removed 
- status of asynchronous objects loading in extensions. It is now possible
  to check the status when all the objects are loaded. This is used by the print view
  (which will be used when printing through wkhtmltopdf).
- document.lastModified converted from GMT to local time 
  (new value assigned to humla.controler.lastModified)

0.2.0 
- major refactoring of the original Humla 0.1 
- possible to define views and extensions in config.json
- every slide has a unique URL either with a slide number or slide id (if exists)
- possibility to assign scripts in config.json to groups so that it is possible
  to manage dependencies on scripts when loading
- developed main extensions for creating outlines, importing drawings from
  Google drawings, importing external references from a Google Spreadsheet, 
  importing images of latex formulas, syntax highlighting

TODO:
- offline with appcache
- server-side functions of extensions such as caching capabilities for drawing extension
- controling of slides from a tutor for live events
- support ajax crawling for slides
